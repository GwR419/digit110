    <title>Shrewsbury Cakes: Original Recipe.</title>

    <paragraph type="background-info">This recipe comes from MS Codex 625, a manuscript recipe book
        that belonged to a student in a London cooking school in the early eighteenth century. The
        pastry school was owned by Edward Kidder, who taught at a few locations in London between
        around <timeline>1720 and 1734</timeline>. Blank books with printed title pages seem to have been used by
        students to write down recipes they learned. Kidder also published his recipes in the
        printed volume, Receipts for Pastry and Cookery, in 1720.</paragraph>

        <step num="7">Bake at <tempature>350F</tempature> for <time>15-18 minutes</time> (ours were
            about 1/3″ thick, so you could roll them thinner and have a slightly shorter cooking
            time).</step>
        <result>They’re done once they turn the slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved
            recipe yielded about two dozen cookies.</result>

    <section>The Results <paragraph>If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these.
            We added the cinnamon because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it rounded
            out the mace nicely. These are mild, fairly soft cookies that are great with tea. We
            rolled and patted the dough into individual cookies because it was too soft and stick to
            roll out, but a little bit more flour and a stint in the fridge might make the dough
            easier to work with a rolling pin.</paragraph></section>
